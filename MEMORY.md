## Workflow Patterns

[LEARN:workflow] Requirements specification phase catches ambiguity before planning → reduces rework 30-50%. Use spec-then-plan for complex/ambiguous tasks (>1 hour or >3 files).

[LEARN:workflow] Spec-then-plan protocol: AskUserQuestion (3-5 questions) → create `quality_reports/specs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md` with MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements → declare clarity status (CLEAR/ASSUMED/BLOCKED) → get approval → then draft plan.

[LEARN:workflow] Context survival before compression: (1) Update MEMORY.md with [LEARN] entries, (2) Ensure session log current (last 10 min), (3) Active plan saved to disk, (4) Open questions documented. The pre-compact hook displays checklist.

[LEARN:workflow] Plans, specs, and session logs must live on disk (not just in conversation) to survive compression and session boundaries. Quality reports only at merge time.

## Documentation Standards

[LEARN:documentation] When adding new features, update BOTH README and guide immediately to prevent documentation drift. Stale docs break user trust.

[LEARN:documentation] Always document new templates in README's "What's Included" section with purpose description. Template inventory must be complete and accurate.

[LEARN:documentation] Guide must be generic (framework-oriented) not prescriptive. Provide templates with examples for multiple workflows (LaTeX, R, Python, Jupyter), let users customize. No "thou shalt" rules.

[LEARN:documentation] Date fields in frontmatter and README must reflect latest significant changes. Users check dates to assess currency.

## Design Philosophy

[LEARN:design] Framework-oriented > Prescriptive rules. Constitutional governance works as a TEMPLATE with examples users customize to their domain. Same for requirements specs.

[LEARN:design] Quality standard for guide additions: useful + pedagogically strong + drives usage + leaves great impression + improves upon starting fresh + no redundancy + not slow. All 7 criteria must hold.

[LEARN:design] Generic means working for any academic workflow: pure LaTeX (no Quarto), pure R (no LaTeX), Python/Jupyter, any domain (not just econometrics). Test recommendations across use cases.

## File Organization

[LEARN:files] Specifications go in `quality_reports/specs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`, not scattered in root or other directories. Maintains structure.

[LEARN:files] Templates belong in `templates/` directory with descriptive names. Currently have: session-log.md, quality-report.md, exploration-readme.md, archive-readme.md, requirements-spec.md, constitutional-governance.md.

## Constitutional Governance

[LEARN:governance] Constitutional articles distinguish immutable principles (non-negotiable for quality/reproducibility) from flexible user preferences. Keep to 3-7 articles max.

[LEARN:governance] Example articles: Primary Artifact (which file is authoritative), Plan-First Threshold (when to plan), Quality Gate (minimum score), Verification Standard (what must pass), File Organization (where files live).

[LEARN:governance] Amendment process: Ask user if deviating from article is "amending Article X (permanent)" or "overriding for this task (one-time exception)". Preserves institutional memory.

## Skill Creation

[LEARN:skills] Effective skill descriptions use trigger phrases users actually say: "check citations", "format results", "validate protocol" → Claude knows when to load skill.

[LEARN:skills] Skills need 3 sections minimum: Instructions (step-by-step), Examples (concrete scenarios), Troubleshooting (common errors) → users can debug independently.

[LEARN:skills] Domain-specific examples beat generic ones: citation checker (psychology), protocol validator (biology), regression formatter (economics) → shows adaptability.

## Memory System

[LEARN:memory] Two-tier memory solves template vs working project tension: MEMORY.md (generic patterns, committed), personal-memory.md (machine-specific, gitignored) → cross-machine sync + local privacy.

[LEARN:memory] Post-merge hooks prompt reflection, don't auto-append → user maintains control while building habit.

## Meta-Governance

[LEARN:meta] Repository dual nature requires explicit governance: what's generic (commit) vs specific (gitignore) → prevents template pollution.

[LEARN:meta] Dogfooding principles must be enforced: plan-first, spec-then-plan, quality gates, session logs → we follow our own guide.

[LEARN:meta] Template development work (building infrastructure, docs) doesn't create session logs in quality_reports/ → those are for user work (slides, analysis), not meta-work. Keeps template clean for users who fork.

## Drift Prevention

[LEARN:drift] `replace_all` on one phrasing (e.g., `"26 skills"`) misses sibling phrasings — `"26 skills, and 21 rules"` (extra "and"), `"26 slash commands"`, `"template's 26"`, `"N skills on day one"` (prose). Count drift hit us 3 times in v1.5.x (PRs #70, #76, #78). Solution: `scripts/check-surface-sync.py` with compound regex patterns as a pre-commit gate. Adding a new phrasing to documentation requires adding a matching regex to the script, otherwise it won't be caught.

[LEARN:drift] Guard against false positives when scanning for template counts: `"3 parallel agents"`, `"17 specialized agents"` (clo-author attribution), `"start with 2-3 skills"` are all legitimate non-template uses of `N + category` phrases. Use compound patterns requiring multiple template-specific tokens on the same line.

## Claude Code Hooks

[LEARN:hooks] Stop-hook block protocol has TWO valid forms: (a) legacy — `exit 2` + reason on stderr; (b) modern — `exit 0` + JSON `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` on stdout. `log-reminder.py` uses the modern form. Audit agents unfamiliar with the modern protocol will flag this as "should exit 2" — false alarm. Documented in `/deep-audit` skill's false-alarm list.

[LEARN:hooks] `initialPermissionMode` in VSCode settings only fires at **session start**. Mid-session mode toggles (via `Shift+Tab` or `/permission-mode`) override the file settings until session end. The 6-tier permission stack: VSCode user / workspace / CLI user / project / project-local / in-session runtime — the last is authoritative. "Prompts fire despite bypass config" is almost always a stale session, not a settings bug.

## Plan→Bypass Framing

[LEARN:safety] Do NOT frame Plan→Bypass as a "safety boundary" or "safety guarantee." Plan approval gives you a chance to review the APPROACH before execution, but exiting plan mode returns the session to `defaultMode` (bypassPermissions), at which point any tool call runs under the full allowlist. Frame as "review-before-execute convenience." If a user needs a real enforcement boundary, they should keep `defaultMode: "default"` and approve each high-risk tool individually.

## Privacy in Diagnostic Skills

[LEARN:privacy] Diagnostic skills that read host-global config (e.g., `~/.claude/`, VSCode user settings) must require **explicit user confirmation** before crossing the repo boundary — especially in template repos that get forked. Phase the skill: repo-local auto, host-global opt-in with key redaction. Codex correctly flagged this pattern as a template-adopter privacy risk in PR #75.
